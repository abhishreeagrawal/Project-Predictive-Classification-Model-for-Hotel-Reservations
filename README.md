# Project-Predictive-Classification-Model-for-Hotel-Reservations
A project on predicting whether a hotel reservation will be canceled or not? 

Problem Statement: The booking options and consumer behavior have been significantly altered by internet hotel reservation 
channels. Due to changes in plans or no-shows, many hotel reservations are canceled. Changes in plans, scheduling issues, and other common causes of cancellations are listed below. This is frequently made simpler for hotel visitors by the ability to do so without charge or preferable at a low cost, 
but it is a less desirable and potentially revenue-decreasing element for hotels to cope with.

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to help identify whether the consumer will keep their reservation or cancel it? More details are mentioned in the _'Hotel Reservations Classification'_ pdf file and the python code is in the _'hotel_reservations'_ ipynb file.
